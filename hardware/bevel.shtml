    <h1>bevel</h1>
    <img src="/images/bevel/bevel_v2_wood_close.jpg" alt="split keyboard with 30 keys">
    <p>the first keyboard I've designed from the ground up, and has been the longest I've consistently used a single keyboard since getting into this mess. Currently on the second revision, the first try had a few issues - nothing that couldn't be worked around, but just annoying enough that I wanted to fix them. I use a slightly-modified footprint for the pro-micro, so the circuit board is flippable for each half but the microcontroller is face-up on both halves.</p>
    <p>designing the bevel was a lot of fun, since it meant an opportunity to learn pcb design, which was much less scary than expected. I use a program called <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">Kicad</a>, which is free and open-source.</p>

    <p>only a few pins on the pro micro support the data line for splitting the halves, so that had to be jumped to a different pin</p>

    <p>another pin needed to be jumped due to a problem in the wiring</p>

    <p>the trrs jack was too close to the pro micro, so I had to trim the plastic casing of the plug</p>

    <p>eventually everything was fixed and it didn't look too bad</p>

    <p>All things considered I think it went well. You can find a copy of the keymap below. Different layers are shown with line breaks on each key, and keycodes in brackets are input when keys are held</p>
