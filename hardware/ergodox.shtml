    <p>my first nonstandard keyboard! even considering all the weird keyboards I've been through, the biggest adjustment was going from row-staggered qwerty to column-staggered split colemak. has way too many keys for my current taste, but still serves a great purpose as a wasd gaming controller.</p>
