    <h1>redshift</h1>

<p> <br>Boots beat down on the ceiling above. Music thudded from below. Light bled around the corners of the curtains, casting dancing strips of brightness onto blank walls. The polished concrete floor glinted, kept free of dust by the quietly hibernating vacuum in the corner. Rubbish piled up near the door, grease-stained brown bags from a myriad of delivery companies waited to be disposed of, empty containers holding onto dregs of food, the air swirling with an international orchestra of stale cuisine. The room was tidy otherwise; the tidiness of a lack of clutter, the trademark minimalism of those that spent little time in the physical world.</p>
<p>Blind and deaf to her surroundings, Arx reclined in the centre of the room, her body-hugging recliner the only furniture in the apartment. Her hair was buzzed short. Her clothes were simple: a plain grey t-shirt without graphics or corporate logos, and faded black leggings. Her feet were bare. One side of her shaved head glowed in the unlit room, barely-visible circuitry flickering beneath her dark skin, the blinking LEDs her sole capitulation to individuality. An extra-long cable ran from her temple to a tablet cradled in limp hands, excess length coiled on the floor. Another cable led from the tablet to a network port in the floor, custom-placed there when she moved in. Her eyes flickered under closed lids as if she was dreaming.</p>
<p>Arx was where she belonged: the Grid.</p>
<p>Full immersion, direct neural interface, biofeedback enabled. Wired up and jacked in, she had no AR glasses, no smartgloves; there was nothing at all between her brain and the roiling sea of data. It was dangerous - consumer hardware came with safeguards for a reason - but for Arx, it was the only way. Anything else felt slow and clumsy, like trying to play a synth with mittens on.</p>
<p>Every nerve ending of her body was on fire. Bright flashing lights, pungent smells, saccharine sweet tastes, pleasure, pain, and countless other sensory stimulations threatened to overwhelm her, to burn through her neurons until she was an empty husk. She basked in it for a moment, feeling her biosigns spiking, adrenaline flooding her system. Just before she reached her limit, she slammed her ad-shields down.</p>
<p>The sensations faded away, blending into the background noise of the Grid. Arx smiled, silently thankful for advertisers' disregard for regulation. There were legal limits in place for how cranked-up simul-ads could be, but the corps ignored them. Any fines levied at them for abusive advertising paled in comparison to profits from extra sales. The corps had the ability to make people taste an ad for a burger, feel the grease dripping down their throats, smell the seasoned meat. Visual ads were a thing of the past. Marketing was an arms race, and the only reason civilians survived a trip to the Grid anymore was because ad-shields were made factory defaults. Now that their target audiences all had dulled senses, the corps boosted their ads up even more to punch through.</p>
<p>This was the Delta. This was where every journey began. No matter if a user jacked in from a penthouse in Delhi or a public access point in the Berlin sprawl, they appeared below the twin towers of Hayashi and Eden, screaming edifices of neon, impossible architecture twisted into logos emblazoned against a black void sky. While all the corps owned a sector of the grid, designed and moderated in-house, hosted on privately-owned servers; the Delta and the Grid's underlying infrastructure was owned by Hayashi and Eden, a collaboration between East and West, an olive branch so large it had grown into an entire tree. The Delta was a reminder of that, an unavoidable symbol of the two corps by whom all virtual business was enabled. It was grating, but it would be corporate suicide not to play along.</p>
<p>From the Delta, there were two paths. Corp workers or people with a destination in mind would punch in Grid coordinates, instantaneously jumping to where they needed to be. Everyone else would drift, browse, wend their way through the bright geometry and sensory stimulation until some passing algorithm shuttled them to a tributary; entertainment, shopping, stupefaction; whatever the user wanted was eventually delivered to them, at a price. There was always a price. Even though the Delta was owned by Hayashi and Eden, it benefited all corps to have a centralised entry point upon which to focus their marketing budgets.</p>
<p>Still recovering, Arx floated with the current, soaking in the sights. With her ad-shields turned up to maximum, the Delta was a rush of white noise and desaturated colour, gradually lessening as the screaming sounds and flashing lights gave way to more relaxed advertising. She allowed herself a little more sensation, and she was stroked with virtual fingers, lulled by programmed scents, the algorithm helping her to bask in the afterglow of her adrenaline rush. Impossibly sharp and jarring architecture gave way to pastel hues and soft curves. If she did not have somewhere to be, Arx would have let herself drift, half motivated by relaxation, half by curiosity. Not allowing herself to be lulled into a stupor, Arx punched in a random set of coordinates.</p>
<p>After a moment, her surroundings were jarringly replaced. She was surrounded by shining white marble, skyscrapers packed with crisp, clean malls towered above her, bending at impossible angles, blocking out the sky. In a moment, she identified it as a shopping zone, Dahab sector. It could have been Cairo, Dubai, or Abu Dhabi, stripped of its individuality, sanitised, and turned up to eleven. Department stores and souqs that mirrored their real-life counterparts sat adjacent to digitised landmarks from halfway around the globe. Down alleyways she could see thousands of doors and archways - portals to private servers where the Grid was less regulated. Sensory snippets leaked from doors left ajar: thumping music, mists of torrential rain, sounds of the forest floor, the acrid stench of ozone, blistering heat, biting cold, too many more to count. Some servers had daemons outside, dumb single-task AI constructs built-for-purpose, in this case accepting entry fees from prospective visitors or simply checking their credentials. Other servers were locked tight, giving away no hint of what hid inside. Anyone could rent a server from Dahab, or any of the other corps; there were guidelines regarding what could be simulated inside a server, but as with any other rules, enough money ensured the corp would look the other way.</p>
<p>A never-ending tide of people streamed through the streets. Most were at ground level, basic subscribers experiencing the minimum the Grid had to offer, jostling for place with the teeming millions. They did not have the implants Arx did, the blazing silicon beneath their skin, the nerve-wire connection to the Grid; they were the type to use AR goggles and gloves, or work directly on their tablets; sitting in homes or public access points, still aware of the real world around them, filling their empty time with retail therapy. Most of them had basic humanoid avatars, the latest virtual fashions straight off the rack.</p>
<p><i>Holographics are in this week</i>, Arx thought to herself.</p>
<p>The next level up held priority traffic. These were the elites of the Grid, the businesspeople who drove around cities in chauffeured sports cars and floated through the Grid above the rabble. Their Grid subscription was more expensive, and came bundled with access to the most fashionable and exclusive private servers. Most were given a subscription by their employer, along with a monthly supply of corp scrip to spend at any of the company stores, just two of the hundreds of perks offered in the perpetual cycles of poaching and headhunting that dominated corp life. Avatars on this level were much more sophisticated. Those that were humanoid at all sported glowing hair of every colour, flowing clothes, all the latest physics and lighting optimisations visible for anyone to see. Most were inhumanly beautiful, carefully crafted to be as alluring as possible. Others were inhuman altogether. Arx saw non-standard body plans, rippling fur, gleaming chrome, scintillating scales; whatever you wanted to be, if you had the money to buy the skin, the Grid would accommodate you.</p>
<p>Arx preferred to go unnoticed. She wore readymade skins, purchased weekly from different vendors. Male, female, androgynous, whatever. She would wear a skin for a week, shred it, and move on. This week she wore a Hayashi skin. Black suit, short black salaryman hair - a clone of any of the thousands of wageslaves that made the digital commute every day.</p>
<p>An alert flickered in her peripheral vision. It was time to move. She punched in another Grid address and waited for the jump.</p>
<p> <br>She shifted through the Grid. Her new location was in the corporate zone of the Hayashi sector. Owned wholesale and completely controlled by Hayashi, the area looked however its corporate designers wanted. The Grid was calmer here. Her surroundings obeyed the basic laws of physics and reason, grey blocks rising up from the ground around her. The contrast between Hayashi's public and corporate spaces could not have been more jarring; Hayashi clearly saved their design budget for their shopping and entertainment zones. Avatars hurried around her, all skinned as salarymen, all wearing suits, all with short-cropped hair. She started walking and soon she was lost in the crowd, one of a thousand near-identical avatars. She travelled like this to her target - a Hayashi business server, one of hundreds in this zone. It was as bland and uninteresting as the rest, even the stylised H on the front was mono-coloured and unanimated.Entry to the server was her eventual aim, but for now she waited, looking for her way in.</p>
<p>She quietly spooled up a program, one of her own design. It was a carefully-written piece of code, optimised for her machine and her mind; not signed, not distributed, barely legal. She called it Snoop. Diagnostic and location data sprung into being above the heads of the avatars moving in and out. A glance would tell her the hardware they were using to connect, their general location in the real world, and any aliases they had connected to their Grid account. If she focussed, she could delve deeper, diving into more personal data. Exact geolocation of their access point, other Grid accounts used on the same hardware, browsing history. It constantly surprised Arx how much data was lying just under the surface, barely hidden by Grid protocols. There were a few things she lacked the access to see, but those tended to be concerned with server-side security. For example, the authcodes they flashed to enter the server appeared as shining blurs held in their hands, the size of cred cards. They were the keys to the front door of the server, but they were coded to the worker that carried them. If she copied an authcode from an unsuspecting wageslave and tried to use it, it would raise alerts as soon as she walked through the server's door.</p>
<p>Above the crowd, packets flew in and out of the server; some large, some small, some slow, some too fast to see. Hayashi was a traditionalist corp, so most appeared as envelopes or packages. Some were encrypted, locks or chains hanging off them as they flew past her. She had the ability to crack all but the toughest of those, but it would take time. She twitched at the thought of so much data flitting past, unread.</p>
<p><i>Easy to copy them, decrypt them later when I've got time</i>, Arx told herself.</p>
<p>With effort, she quashed the thought. She was here on a job. There was no time for sightseeing, and no time for mistakes.</p>
<p>Arx threaded a string of her consciousness to record the data Snoop was collecting, while she concentrated on keeping an eye out for authorities. What she was doing was not illegal per se, but any security the server had would certainly want to ask her some very pointed questions. Arx was not worried. It never took much to disappear into the noise of the Grid. No-one had time for boring, no-one had time for grey. If you looked unimportant, most people ignored you.</p>
<p>Arx sensed movement above her, a sense of unease building in the base of her skull. She looked up and almost jacked out then and there. There was a warden perched on the side of the building. It must have been running silent - she could only see it out of the corner of her eye, and only because she had Snoop loaded. Even if it had not been hanging off a Hayashi server, she would have been able to tell who it worked for - no other corp skinned their wardens as Japanese demons. It was recognisable as a blue oni, but it was long-limbed and skeletal, its taut skin stretched thin over emaciated ribs. Its splayed hands and feet adhered to the server and its horned head swung side to side, sniffing packets as they streamed in and out of the building.</p>
<p>It looked bored, eyelids drooping, and the third eye in the middle of its forehead was completely closed. It must have been a slow day.</p>
<p><i>What the fuck is that doing here?</i> Arx thought, <i>And why employ a warden if it's just going to be a guard dog?</i></p>
<p> She mentally sighed, pulling herself together.<i>The things I do for family.</i></p>
<p>Forcing herself not to hurry, she began to craft a probe. She used a fraction of the processing power available to her. Snoop was lightweight, but she was already running close to what the average user's hardware was capable of. Any more juice and she would start to raise red flags. With the warden above her, attention was the last thing she needed. The probe began to take shape. It was wrapped as a system diagnostic, a simple inquiry from the Grid as to the warden's status. Grid oversight was usually an automated process, but idle users were occasionally prompted to manually confirm their status. If someone had fallen asleep while connected to the Grid, the system sent an inquiry their way. If the Grid did not receive a response, the user would be gently logged out and dropped into natural sleep. The warden certainly looked inattentive; packet sniffing was a job more suited to a daemon than a human, especially a human skilled and experienced enough to be a warden.</p>
<p>With her tablet throttled down to consumer-grade levels, it took Arx ten minutes to finish the probe. It was not her finest work, but it was simple enough, she hoped, that the warden would not suspect it. It looked like a tiny drone, like any one of the thousands that swarmed outside her window in the real world. She signed the probe with a recently-stolen system diagnostic signature, scrubbed any identifiable metadata, and sent it on its way. The tiny drone zipped into the distance, losing itself in the crowds, before circling back to her target.</p>
<p>The warden took a cursory glance at her probe, stroked it with a slender finger, and sent it back. As soon as its finger made contact, data popped in above the warden's head and it became entirely visible, no longer a shadow seen out of the corner of her virtual eye. The warden was still running silent, invisible to the general public, but by authenticating itself to her probe it had given her the lowest level of access to its system; not enough to get inside it and start rummaging around, but enough that Snoop worked properly.</p>
<p><i>Nice to know your name, Warden Sato Kazuo.</i> Arx thought to herself, <i>I hope we don't become any more acquainted.</i></p>
<p>Arx scanned the readouts of data floating above the oni's horns. She was right: the Hayashi GAD-7 the warden was using to access the Grid was running at less than a percent of its max capacity. The fact he was based in Tokyo was not a surprise to her: Hayashi tended to employ local talent wherever they could, a foreigner that held a permanent job with Hayashi was rare. They left the offshore jobs to one of their thousands of child companies.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a security professional, huge swathes of the warden's profile were locked-down. She had no access to his exact geolocation, alt accounts, browsing history, or any other fun details. For those, she would have to delve deeper, a prospect that caused her no small amount of anxiety. For now, she flagged the warden and left him to his own devices. If he moved, loaded any programs, or his machine clocked over one-percent capacity, Arx would be notified. For the moment, she turned back to the crowds, an idea forming.</p>
<p><i>If Spook has access to the warden...</i> Arx began to edit her Grid settings, her vision stuttering as she routed her perception through her access to the warden. Esoteric routines hidden to most users, these were options she had barely touched, yet she flew through them with the instinctive confidence of a Grid native. A few final tweaks and the slate-grey walls of the server fell away, replaced by a transparent wireframe.</p>
<p>While the Grid was chained to a certain level of normality, admins skinned their servers however they liked. Arx had seen deep-sea landscapes, sky-high collections of balloons, spacewalks, forests, avatars sprouting wings and flying free, futurist techno rave-clubs, and far stranger environments. The inside of the Hayashi server disappointed her. Wageslaves' avatars sat at virtual desks. The floor was clad in bland carpet, the walls were painted a light beige. It looked for all the world like a brick-and-mortar office.</p>
<p><i>They may as well be going to work in meatspace,</i> Arx thought to herself, shaking her head, <i>What a waste.</i></p>
<p>Looking away from the server, she saw another consequence of her tinkering. The avatars filing into the building looked much the same as before, save for one important detail: the shining cards the workers held came into focus, censorship removed by the warden's increased access.</p>
<p>Arx chose one at random, and copied it into her internal storage. It was packed tightly, reams of identifying data squashed into a tiny space. She split off another thread of her consciousness to unpack it and checked her hardware utilisation. She was still within consumer-level parameters, but only barely. If her consciousness had been present in the real world, she would have heard her machine's hard drive whining to keep up with the new storage requirements. She could run this hot for ten more minutes, she estimated, before the warden started sniffing in her direction.</p>
<p>Arx looked back to the server, the twin background tasks she had threaded buzzing in the back of her skull. Amongst the beige office space, there were some regions of the building she could not see into. They appeared as dark patches in her vision, only visible if she concentrated, even Spook's heightened access was not enough. These dark zones were locked vaults, only accessible to a select few, and only then after a rigorous series of identity-confirming tests. She would check the rest of the server as a precaution, but her instincts told her the data she needed was in one of those vaults.</p>
<p>With nothing to do but wait, Arx found herself staring at the warden. It was running silent, but surely some of the workers could sense it hanging off the wall, some stray subroutine tickling their amygdala, alerting them to the hidden threat. Usually wardens were visible, serving as a deterrent to illegal activity. As Arx's gaze drifted to the warden, she wondered if the sourceless sense of dread was more effective in ensuring compliance.</p>
<p>Her considerations were interrupted by an alert. The authcode was unpacked and ready to be edited. Working quickly, stealing glances at the warden the entire time, she began to make edits. The simplest were surface-level: changing the owner's Grid handle to her own, changing the name and personal details to randomly-generated garbage. She checked her name: for the rest of the job, she was Samejima Taisuke. The greater issue was that the authcode had already been used minutes ago, and the user it was assigned to was still inside the server.</p>
<p>She inserted a snippet of code into the authentication protocol. It would hide the warning that the user she had stolen the authcode from was already inside the server and replace it with an innocuous alert. If anyone looked at the authentication logs they would be able to see two entrances into the server; she had no way of hiding that. Arx intended to be long gone before anyone checked the logs.</p>
<p>She joined the crowds of workers walking towards the server. Entering the server was as simple as waving her cracked authcode at a drone and stepping through the door.</p>
<p>There was no lobby, no smiling receptionist to greet her. This was the corporate version of a factory farm, with not even a virtual water cooler in sight. Cubicles stretched ahead of her, the space inside far larger than its outside footprint, the only concession to the infinite possibilities of the Grid.</p>
<p>Arx smiled to herself. The hard work was done. The beauty of the stringent security measures outside the server was that once she had circumvented them, everyone would assume she was meant to be inside. She ducked into an empty cubicle.</p>
<p>She was faced with an uncomfortable wheeled chair, worn carpet, a chunky beige computer. Arx blinked and an overlay appeared in front of her, showing any virtual objects in the cubicle that had a purpose greater than simple props. A cracked in-tray on the desk hid a sophisticated document search and delivery system, and an intercom served as an intra-office messaging network.</p>
<p>They're certainly committing to the corpo office fantasy.</p>
<p>Arx sat down, momentarily admiring the effort that went into programming the barely-covered springs under the chair's threadbare upholstery. Hayashi purposefully subverted the flexibility and freedom of the Grid, making their virtual workplaces as bland and soul-crushing as possible. She gave the antique computer that sat atop the desk a derisive look and made a series of gestures over the in-tray, initiating a server-wide search. Wherever her target was located on the server, the search would find it. If it was within a vault, as she suspected, she would not have permission to view or copy it, but at the very least she would know where it was being kept. While the search was running, she thumbed a button on the intercom. She needed higher permissions to access vaults, and the only way to get the access she needed was for someone to give it to her.</p>
<p>As she was waiting for an answer, she composed a quick message to herself. Using her connection to the server's messaging network she bounced it off the server daemon, flagging the message as having originated from inside the server. Still on hold, she browsed her way through employee registers and rosters, saving them to her machine while familiarising herself with names, roles, and timetables with a practised eye. This was where she excelled, memorising swathes of information that might be useful later.</p>
<p>A static hiss came from the intercom, followed by a young male voice speaking in Japanese.</p>
<p>"Hello, this is Sakamoto Yatsuhiro from support. How can I help you?"</p>
<p>Arx switched mental gears, talking to another human for the first time that day. She spoke Japanese, but her accent was clearly foreign, something that would give her away immediately. She spooled up a voice modulator, punched in her desired parameters, and replied. Her voice was played back to her as she spoke, a perfect facsimile of a Hayashi salaryman.</p>
<p>"Hi Sakamoto-san. I am very sorry to bother you, but I'm having trouble with my access. It's my first day as an archive officer, and I can't seem to access any of the vaulted data."</p>
<p>There was silence from the other end of the line. Arx gritted her virtual teeth, expecting an alert to be raised, mentally preparing the commands that would log her out of the server and dump her back into the real world.</p>
<p>Finally, Sakamoto replied, "Many apologies, Samejima-san."</p>
<p>Arx's tension bled out, replaced with warm satisfaction. He used the fake name Arx assigned herself when she cracked her authcode.</p>
<p>Sakamoto continued, oblivious to her relief, "I cannot find any record of you being assigned the archive officer role. In fact..."</p>
<p>Arx interrupted, "Oh, sorry. I have my reassignment message right here. I'll forward it to you."</p>
<p>Pausing just long enough to make it seem unplanned, she forwarded the message she composed earlier. Another moment passed as Sakamoto read it.</p>
<p>The intercom crackled again as he replied. "Samejima-san? I can temporarily give you vault access, but I will need to check with your manager to permanently assign your new role. Who appointed you?"</p>
<p>Arx flipped through the roster she had saved, picking an archive manager from the list that was marked as absent. Before he could confirm, she thanked him for his time; her voice bright and sweet as she hung up. Her automated search completed, a sheet of paper with a single entry at the top appeared in the in-tray. She had her target, and she had access.</p>
<p> <br>The vault looked like nothing special. A simple door with an antique card-reader prevented access. Arx swiped her authcode and, with a final glance behind her, walked through the threshold.</p>
<p>As soon as the door closed behind her, she was cut off. No access to the public Grid, no access to the server. The only way in was through a triple-locked encrypted line between her access point and the vault. Given enough time she might have been able to crack it, but it would be a matter of minutes before the support tech realised no-one at the company had heard of Samejima Taisuke.</p>
<p>The inside of the vault was as beige as the outside. Four walls, one door, worn carpet on the floor. Twelve manila filing cabinets lined the walls. Even in their private vaults, Hayashi produced virtual spaces that were mirror images of the real world. The centre of the room held a scuffed metal desk, a ledger sitting atop it. Arx rolled her eyes. Another unimaginative skin for a document registry. She pinged it with the file she was looking for and the book flipped open to show her where it was held. From there, it was as simple as opening the filing cabinet and taking the folder out. As she began the process of shredding the file, her focus wandered over the manila cabinets. She checked a progress bar. Shredding data took a while.</p>
<p><i>A quick look won't hurt.</i></p>
<p>Before she had a chance to stop herself, she was rifling through virtual drawers, indiscriminately copying anything that looked interesting. Financial projections, private contracts, transaction ledgers. A compressed package caught her eye, and she copied it without even unpacking it first. Her hardware utilisation crept up to consumer-grade levels, and slowly surpassed them. She dismissed the alert with a flick of a finger.</p>
<p><i>This is a restricted area, it's not like anyone can see me. I'll take just a few more.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a dark, mostly-empty apartment, thousands of kilometres from Tokyo, Arx lay still. Only the rapid movement of her eyes behind closed lids betrayed her mental activity. Her tablet's temperature rose a few degrees, nearly-noiseless fans speeding up their spin, the hard drive whirring as it struggled to accommodate the new data. As the clocks hit 0200, Arx's robotic vacuum nosed out of its cradle and began to sweep the floor. The thudding music continued from below, the sounds of a party in full swing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An alert broke Arx from her trance. The shredding task had been completed. It was time to leave. She tore herself away from the cabinets, shaking with the effort of leaving so much data unread. She cracked the door ajar, disconnecting her from the vault and opening a low-bandwidth connection to the outside server. Not enough for her to see anything, just enough to check on the warden she had flagged earlier. The oni remained lurking outside the server, still running silent, his machine still under one percent capacity. Emboldened by how easily she had slipped beneath his three-eyed gaze, Arx opened the door of the vault with a gesture.</p>
<p>Behind the door stood a smartly-dressed figure, three-piece suit pulled taut by concealed muscles, red tie artfully loosened. His skin was red, his clawed hands and feet vibrant crimson against the beige of the server. Two pairs of tusks protruded from his mouth, upwards and downwards. Two eyes glared at her, and the third in the middle of his forehead gazed terribly ahead, as if it saw right through her.</p>
<p><i>Shit, should have guessed. Red and blue</i>, she thought.</p>
<p>He was upon her. A clawed hand ripped through her firewalls, rending her artfully crafted security protocols to ribbons. His other hand shot forward, gripped her by the neck, lifted her off the floor. His claws sank into her flesh. Stabbing pain. Real pain. She felt malicious code injected where he broke her skin, worming its way into her machine and mind alike, corrupting as it went. Warnings sprung up in her peripherals, alerting her to the damage. More warnings; the warden was tracing the location of her access point in the real world.</p>
<p>Quick as thought, she gave the signal to jack out. Disconnecting from the Grid without following the proper protocols would hurt, but any cracker worth their machine knew when to cut and run. She steeled herself for the nausea, the mental blow, the explosion of pain behind the eyes.</p>
<p>Nothing happened.</p>
<p>The oni grinned. One clawed finger rose into her vision, waving from side to side.</p>
<p>"You're not getting away from me. Can't wait to see what you look like in the flesh." He sneered around his tusks, tongue darting out to taste the air.</p>
<p>His fingers tightened around her neck, and her vision fractured. Her perception centres were being corrupted. Working on instinct, she cut herself off from everything but essential functions, quarantining her mind from the attack.</p>
<p>Her vision went black. She could not feel her arms, her legs, anything. She was incorporeal, bodyless, floating in an endless sea of black. The pain was still there, but far away, a simple indication something was wrong. She opened diagnostics, green and red text springing into existence behind her eyes, imprinted directly into her consciousness. The green text was turning red. She estimated she had seconds before her nonessential functions were completely corrupted.</p>
<p>Seconds in the Grid meant everything. She kicked her machine into high gear, disabling her safeguards. The red wave slowed its advance and the seconds stretched into minutes. Her tablet began to heat up, component temperatures climbing towards maximum recommended limits. She gave the logout command again. No response. She scanned through diagnostics. The warden was running a trace on her real-world position, and jack out protocols were the first thing he had attacked. She was trapped in the grid. Locked out of her body to be picked up at their leisure. It was that, or she would overclock too high and fry her brain stem.</p>
<p><i>Fuck this guy,</i> she thought to herself, <i>Who does he think he is? Just a jumped-up wageslave, hopped-up on chems, high on his new toy.</i></p>
<p>If she had lips, she would have sneered.</p>
<p><i>He's not taking me alive. He's not taking me at all.</i></p>
<p>Arx queued a command to encrypt her entire drive, burning the authcode into her neocortex. She could start the process with a thought, as soon as the warden broke through to her essential functions. Running as hot as she was, it would be over in microseconds. It was a last resort, ensuring the data she carried would be unrecoverable in the event of her death. She spent precious fractions of a second composing a message to her sister, queuing it to send it as soon as she had access to the grid.</p>
<p>A happy chime told her the message had been sent.</p>
<p>She stopped, milliseconds ticking by. It was obvious, in hindsight. The warden's attack had not locked her out of the Grid, it had locked her in. She still had access to everything.</p>
<p>She sent a simple command to a simple machine.</p>
<p> <br>In a nearly-empty apartment, a robotic vacuum received a new instruction from its hibernation cradle. It turned ninety degrees to its left, motor running at full speed. A cable, usually big enough to trigger its avoidance protocols, became tangled in its mechanism. The vacuum ejected the blockage and continued its work.</p>
<p> <br>Arx screamed. She was soaked in sweat, her implants felt like they were hot enough to burn through her skull, and her stomach was trying to crawl out of her throat. Her temple blazed with pain where the vacuum had ripped the plug from her and her tablet's casing was scalding hot.</p>
<p>She had never been so happy to be in her body.<br></p>
