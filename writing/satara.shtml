    <p>SETTING</p>
    <p>A police interview room. Two chairs face each other across a small table. The scene is lit by a hanging lamp, gently swaying. BELSNER and CHARLIE are seated.
        BELSNER wears a police uniform and writes in a small notebook with the stub of a pencil.
        CHARLIE looks ragged and slighlty lost, but is doing their best to answer BELSNER's questions.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    BELSNER<br>
    You've seen her?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Course I've seen her. Every Wednesday at Rigney's. They say it's a private function out front, but Rigney lets the regulars in anyway --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    And that's you?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    A regular.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, I guess. Rigney lets me in on Wednesdays so --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    That makes you a regular.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, I guess<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BEAT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    She's there on Wednesdays. Sits in the corner booth with the rest of 'em. A Northerner, that old bloke, and a horse girl.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Horse girl?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    One of them wilders. Smells like horse.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Oh, I thought you meant --<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Doesn't matter. Go on.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Four of 'em sit in the corner booth. Two on each side. Got a sign and everything.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    A sign?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, a sign. Says 'Handsome Cat Theatre Company'.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Like the one down in Southbank?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Like the what?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    The theatre company.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    There's a theatre company in Southbank?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Yeah, it's called the Handsome Cat Theatre Company.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Like the sign?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Like the sign the Northerner, the old bloke, and the horse girl have? The ones who sit in the corner booth with --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Don't say her name.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    I wasn't gonna. I'm not stupid, you know. I was gonna say 'her'. I'm not stupid<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Just taking precautions. You can't be too careful.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BEAT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Go on.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Like I said, she comes to Rigney's every Wednesday night, sits in the corner booth with --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    The Northerner, the old bloke, and the horse girl. And they have a sign.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, like a sandwitch board. It says 'Handsome Cat Theatre Company', and underneath it says 'Tryouts Tonight'.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Tryouts?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, Tryouts. Like for their theatre.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER [ASIDE]<br>
    Auditions.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Auditions. That's what tryouts for the theatre are called. Auditions.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Auditions. Tryouts for the theatre. Auditions.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BEAT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Then why does it say Tryouts?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    On the sign, I mean. If tryouts for the theatre are called auditions, 
    why does the sign say 'Tryouts Tonight'? It should say 'Auditions Tonight', 
    if that's what tryouts for the theatre are called. What's the point of 
    having a different name specifically for theatre tryouts if you're not 
    going to use it?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Maybe they don't know the word 'audition'.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    You're telling me these people, who run auditions at Rigney's every Wednesday
    night, who probably run a theatre down in Southbank, don't know the meaning 
    of the word 'audition'?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    No need to get worked up. You didn't know it until I told youe<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, well I don't host auditions at Rigney's every Wednesday night, do I? 
    I don't probably run a theatre down in fuckin' Southbank, do I? I've not 
    participated in any fuckin' theatre productions, because I'm a fuckin' butcher. 
    Now if these Handsome Cat Theatre people didn't know where to find the oysters 
    on a chook, or how to properly slit and bleed a pig, I wouldn't be surprised. 
    But when it comes down to basic fuckin' industry procedures, they should be up 
    to fuckin' date with their terminology.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    No need to get worked up<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Fuck you, pig. You think you can come down from Hayfair and --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER [ROARS]<br>
    I said --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER [QUIETLY]<br>
    No need to get worked up.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    THEY SIT IN SILENCE<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    As you were saying. She comes in to Rigney's every Wednesday night, sits in
    the corner booth with the Northerner, the old man, and the horse girl.
    They have a sign, advertising tryouts --<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE [ASIDE]<br>
    Auditions<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    -- for their theatre company, which may or may not be in Southbank. What happens next?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    They do the auditions.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Right there at Rigney's?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Right there at Rigney's. Every Wednesday night. They have a chair for people to sit in, they ask them questions, sometimes make 'em do stuff.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    What kind of stuff?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    All kinds. There was a bloke last week who juggled.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Juggled?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, juggled. Balls, knives, whatever. Donnie, I think they called him. Donnie the Fool. Dressed like a clown.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    What?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Dressed like a clown. Big shoes, bells on hat, whole nine yards.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Weird.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Not really. You get some odd ones at Rigney's. Maddy Mad Eyes, Reuben Whispers, Bulletproof Brooks --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Bulletproof Brooks?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Why bulletproof?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    She's bulletproof.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    As in...<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    As in bulletproof. Seen her get shot point-blank in the face, nothing. Pistols, rifles, whatever. Said she even took a cannon shot once. Bulletproof.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Incredible. Do you know how I could contact her? That ability could be very useful in my line of work.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    No can do, guv.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Why not?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    She's dead. Couple months back.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BEAT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Got stabbed.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Shame.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BEAT<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    We're getting sidetracked. I need to know what part she plays in the tryouts.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Who, Brooks?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    No, her.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Oh. She just sits there mostly. Seems to listen to what everyone's saying but --<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Sometimes it's hard to tell.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah. The old bloke tends to ask her what she thinks at the end of each audition, though.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    What does she say?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Not much. Sometimes she tilts her head or waves a hand.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    And that means something to the old man?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yeah, he'll nod too, or raise an eyebrow. And sometimes the people will smile and nod and shake hands, and sometimes they go away.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    But she never actually speaks?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Sometimes she leans over and whispers to the old man.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    And?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    And what?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    And what does she whisper?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Dunno, she whispers real quiet.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Really.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yes.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    No, I meant -- Nevermind. You're saying she has the final say on if auditionees are accepted?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Well, she -- 'auditionees'?<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    The people who audition.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Nah, that's not a word. Auditionees. Doesn't sound right. Auditionees.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Look, it's simple. The suffix 'ee' can be added to transitive, or more rarely, intransitive verbs to form nouns meaning a person who is the object or subject of that verb. Interview, interviewee. Examine, examinee. Audition, auditionee. Perfectly valid lexical construction.<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Still doesn't sound right.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Let me get this straight. You are a butcher who, until a minute ago, did not know the word audition. I am a well-educated police sergeant, who taught you the pronunciation and meaning of said word. You are now telling me that auditionee is not a real word, based on the evidence that it 'does not sound right'. Have I got that straight?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yes.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER [SHOUTS]<br>
    I've just about had enough of your fucking lip! I am on the tail of a dangerous criminal, and you are fucking me around. You must think you're hot shit, drip-feeding the sergeant just enough so I'll go sniffing somewhere else, but I've got news for you. I'm being the good cop right now. You just say the word, you push me one step too far, and this goes from an interview to a fucking interrogation. I know who you are, I know where you work, I know the people you drink with. I know you live on 16 Dunslough Road in that shithole you call an apartment, and that you sleep alone every night. No-one to watch out for you, no one to call for help. Who would you run to anyway? Not the police, that's for sure. I fucking own you, Charlie Artwood, and you will tell me what I need to know, or so help me gods, you'll meet the bad cop. Do I make myself fucking clear?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yes.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    Yes what?<br>
    <br>
    CHARLIE<br>
    Yes sir.<br>
    <br>
    BELSNER<br>
    So, let's start from the beginning. They meet every Wednesday, at Rigney's. They've got a sign that says 'tryouts' --<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    LIGHTS OUT<br>
    <br>
