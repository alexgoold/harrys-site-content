    <h1>gods above</h1>
    
<p> <br>Kend cursed quietly. The two candles they were permitted guttered faintly. The wheels of the cart she was pushing squeaked, weighed down by bags of coffee beans stacked atop each other. The tunnel they trudged through seemed to close in on her, sand falling from cracks in the wooden ceiling, the ground uneven. Though not tall, the roof was low enough that she had to bend over the cart, arms and back protesting with every step. She cursed Art for getting them into this mess. She cursed Wyn for offering her the job. Most of all, she cursed herself for thinking she could steal from gods.</p>
<p> <br>Five days earlier, Kend was waiting, gaze turned skyward, squinting against the hot desert sun. Swathed in a threadbare cloak, she was the mirror image of the dozens of beggars scattered around the market. She nestled in the gap between two stalls, the bowl in front of her empty save for the two bits she had placed there herself. The previous resident had been only too happy to move when she had dropped a whole notch into his bowl, and she now had the best spot in the market. The scents of fragrant spices wafted around her, the raucous bustle of business cocooned her in comforting anonymity. Her target lay before her: an edifice of red stone, a slab festooned with cornices and architraves. Every inch was decorated with elaborate relief; vines twisted around fruits Kend had never seen, unfamiliar animals roared or fed or slept or bathed, stone people toiled at every labour imaginable. In the centre, halfway up the wall, were two figures, easily forty paces tall. One was a god, face hidden behind the ever-present mask, familiar features twisted into a rictus grin. From stone shoulders draped stone silks, lovingly sculpted trains of fabric, billowing in an imaginary breeze. The other figure could only have been a demon. It was enveloped in flames, so realistically carved they seemed to dance around the creature. From the flames came rending claws, gnashing teeth, and a great eye, terrible and malevolent even rendered in unmoving stone. The relief showed the moment the demon was killed; the god's longspear skewered it through the heart. The implication was clear and impressed upon citizens from birth: the gods had killed demons to protect you, now you serve the gods.</p>
<p>The only areas of the wall clear of eye-watering detail were the empty archways, eight black slits yawning out of the red rock. Each only wide enough to admit two people shoulder-to-shoulder, the lowest was ten paces tall. The tallest, placed so high Kend had to squint against the midday sun to see it, was easily fifty paces from arch to floor. It was these Kend watched. Her keen eyes darted between them, never focussing on one for too long, scanning for movement. These were the doors of the gods. No steps led to them and no bridges allowed access, for gods could fly.</p>
<p>A passing trader jostled her, knocking her bowl over, and Kend nearly lost her balance. She turned her head to swear at him when her eyes caught a flicker of movement in one of the doors.  She returned her gaze upward, the trader forgotten, and she strained to see what had caught her notice. Just as she thought she had imagined it, Kend saw it again. Near the top of the third archway, sunlight glinted off metal. She glanced around, wriggled further into the alcove she crouched in, and pulled her ragged hood further over her face. With the same hand, she surreptitiously raised a spyglass to her eye. The brass contraption had not been easy to acquire; she had bought it under cover of darkness down at the docks. The pale smuggler who had sold it to her risked execution if their transaction was discovered. Spyglasses, telescopes, and any other seeing instruments were deemed heretical and forbidden to the citizens of her city. Seeing the distant scene jump into detail, she could see why.</p>
<p>High up the wall, half-hidden in one of the slits cutting through the rock, two gods argued. Mirror images of the carving on the wall, though ten times smaller, they waved arms and shook fists, sneering silver masks lending them an aura of contempt. Unlike the formal duels that took place high above the city, this looked like a disagreement between people, not divinities. Without the masks and paces-long silk capes, they would look for all the world like any of the bickering merchants Kend could see around her; save the fact they were hovering seventy paces from the ground. Kend's free hand scrambled furiously for her notebook, and she cursed herself for not keeping it closer. Not taking her eye off the gods for a second, she flipped to a new page and began writing. First came descriptions of them; colours of their capes, patterns of their clothes. One was in red, the other blue. They could have been male or female: all gods wore their hair long and the flowing silks they wore obscured their forms. Huge trains of silk, easily twenty paces long, hung from their shoulders, waving gently in the breeze. With descriptions complete, Kend moved on to what they were doing; every gesture, every shift in body language. Her pencil flew across the book, filling one, two, then three pages with cryptic shorthand, stopping only to flip to the next when one was full.</p>
<p>Her hand started to cramp. She continued writing. It was only when she had filled five pages that the gods shook hands, having come to some agreement; the one in red drifted back through the archway, while the one in blue adjusted their silks and mask, and flew out into the light. They drifted with the slow nobility common to their kind. Some people in the market looked skyward and made signs of devotion, but most continued about their day, ignorant or indifferent towards the figure that flew high above them.</p>
<p>Kend remained there for the rest of the day, though no sighting proved as fruitful as the argument. Some passers-by dropped money into her cup, murmuring blessings or well-wishes. Soon the sun set and it became too dark for her to see the edifice. The air grew cold almost immediately, traders packed up their stalls, lantern-men went about their business, and food hawkers took over the square. As the air filled with the smell of roasting chestnuts and the sound of sizzling meat, Kend used the commotion to slip away, receiving a toothless smile and a blessing as she dropped her days takings in a beggar's cup.</p>
<p> <br>It took Kend twenty minutes of navigating dingy alleyways to arrive back at the hideout. Hidden from prying eyes in the basement of a carpenter's shop, it provided a secure meeting place for their crew. Kend entered through the front of the shop, smiled and waved at the men still at work despite the late hour, before arriving at an unmarked door tucked into a corner of the shop. She rapped a short series of knocks before withdrawing a key from a pocket in her cloak. She cracked the door ajar and slipped inside, nimbly navigating the dark steps to the basement. Another door, another key, another series of knocks, and she was admitted into the inner sanctum. Unfinished furniture cluttered the room. Dust hung in the air. It was dimly lit by guttering lanterns: open flames were strictly prohibited in the hideout. It smelt of sawdust and sweat and raw ambition. It fit the part of a criminal den perfectly. A woman hunched over a table in the middle of the room, seated on a wheelchair, nursing a bottle. Her hair was unkempt, her clothes creased. Her eyes glinted in the lanternlight, keenly poring over the sheets of paper that covered the table. A thin stream of sawdust trickled from the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Wyn, I'm back." Kend spoke quietly. The ceiling was thick enough to dull the sounds of sawing and sanding from above.</p>
<p>Wyn looked up. Her voice cracked from disuse. She had not spoken since that morning.</p>
<p>"You're the first to return. Take a seat, help yourself to a nip of treacle or an ale." She gestured to a crate in the corner, lid pried open, bottles inside glinting in the lamplight.</p>
<p>"How was your day? Did you learn anything about our target?" Wyn continued.</p>
<p>Even in their underground hideout, noises of carpentry masking their conversation from any eavesdroppers, she could not bring herself to put words to what they planned to do, and against whom they planned.</p>
<p>Kend placed her notebook on the table. She stalked to the crate, withdrew a bottle, removed the cork with her teeth, and took a swig. Viscous treacle dropped slowly out of the bottle, filling Kend with a blossoming warmth as she swallowed. Wyn raised her eyebrows, but said nothing. Still silent, Kend drew a half-carved chair to the table and fell into it. Only then did she open her book and start reading. She stopped for a moment when Elena and Art, the other two members of the crew, arrived. Elena was slightly out of breath. Sweat beaded on her scalp, clearly visible under her close-cropped hair. She did not stop for greetings or pleasantries before stomping to the crate of booze. Art was polite as ever: he kissed Kend on the cheek and gave a short bow to Wyn, straight black hair falling in front of his face. He tucked his hair behind an ear and smiled, gesturing at Kend to continue. She was only too happy to comply: she needed the others to know what she had seen. When she reached the end of her notes, she was met with silence.</p>
<p>"They argued?"</p>
<p>The speaker was Wyn, the orchestrator of the job in which they found themselves. Her hair pulled into a bun and her features twisted into an incredulous frown, she looked for all the world like a chaplain interrogating a recalcitrant student.</p>
<p>Before Kend could answer, Elena interjected. She shook her head in disbelief, droplets of sweat speckling the scattered papers.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it wasn't a duel?" She gripped the table with both hands, corded muscles taut beneath her skin.</p>
<p>Kend looked at Art, the only one to keep quiet. His thin lips were pulled into a grimace, but as she looked at him he shrugged, twinkling eyes inviting her to continue.</p>
<p>Kend shook her head.</p>
<p>"It looked like one of them had been cheated on a deal." She shrugged. "I can read it again if you'd like. I only wrote down what I saw."</p>
<p>The rest of them shook their heads, none of them eager to hear what amounted to heresy again. An uneasy silence descended onto the basement.</p>
<p>Wyn cleared her throat. Everyone jumped, snapped back to the reality of their situation.</p>
<p>"Thank you Kend, that has given us a lot to think about." She shook her head, her look of stunned disbelief slowly fading. "Elena and Art; what did the two of you find out?"</p>
<p>Elena was the first to speak. She had spent the day in coffee houses, bars, unsavoury haunts all over the city. Any questions she had asked about the house of the gods - the red rock edifice Kend had been watching - had been rebuffed; people's reactions ranging from quiet, nervous excuses to outright accusations of apostasy. Finally, she asked the wrong people the wrong sort of question one too many times, and found herself pursued by a group of priests.</p>
<p>At this point, Art interjected. He had spent the day in a cafe in the shadow of the monolith. As he told it, he had made a great many friends, plying customers and staff alike with the strong, aromatic coffee popular in the city, more often than not spiked with treacle. The cafe closed at sundown, as the night markets opened and drew clientele out onto the streets with promises of toffee, roasted chestnuts, and steaming-hot kebabs to warm against the cold desert night. The staff, Art's new friends, allowed him to remain in the cafe, where they broke out a new bottle of treacle, a set of shot glasses, and quickly set to the business of getting drunk. This was around the time he saw Elena sprint past the front door of the cafe. He made his apologies, downed a shot of treacle at the insistence of his new friends, and walked out the front door straight into Elena's pursuers. The collision that followed gave Elena time to get away, and resulted in a shiny purple bruise Art proudly rolled his sleeve up to show.</p>
<p>Art raised a single finger, dramatic as always, and revealed what he had learned throughout the day. The cafe he had chosen to stake out was a supplier of coffee to a great many people throughout the city including, to everyone's amazement, the gods themselves. It was supposed to be a secret, but after a few drinks the staff proudly revealed the hidden tunnels in the basement that led directly underneath the gods' home.</p>
<p> <br>And so it was five days, some hefty bribes, and what felt like an eternity of pushing a cart later that Kend found herself under the red rock edifice. Art walked in front with a slate and stylus, looking for all the world like an overeager supervisor ready to crack down on the slightest misstep in proceedings. Kend pushed the cart, and Elena brought up the rear. She was stronger than Kend, but her hands needed to be free if they ran into any resistance surpassing Art's considerable charm. Above their heads the ceiling changed from wooden slats to red rock, and the tunnel began to slope upward, sand underfoot giving way to stone. Art looked back at the two women, his smile barely forced at all. Kend simply gritted her teeth and pushed harder. Gradually the ceiling rose, until the group found they could walk comfortably. Without any fanfare, the tunnel ended. They found themselves at a landing where a red rock door blocked their path, carved with similar imagery to the outside of the edifice.</p>
<p>Art gave Kend and Elena a final look, turned to the door, and knocked three times. The sound echoed down the tunnel, reverberating off the stone walls. They waited in silence, the enormity of what they had embarked on weighing more heavily upon them than the tons of stone above.</p>
<p>It seemed minutes before the doors opened, swinging noiselessly on oiled hinges. It was dark beyond the door; two almost-invisible figures stood before them, clad head-to-toe in black wrappings. Fabric covered their faces, with small slits left for the nose and mouth. One of the figures held out an arm for Art's slate, obviously in a hurry, foot tapping in impatience. The other approached the cart, hands outstretched in an effort to find it. Paralysed by shock, Kend watched as the shrouded figure around, finally laying a questing hand on a bag of coffee beans. They bent over the cart, sniffing, poking, and prodding the bag before they were convinced. As they straightened, Elena took a quick step behind them, drew a blackjack from her belt, and brought it across the back of their head. They crumpled, sprawling over the cart. As Elena moved, so did Art. He tackled the black-clad auditor to the ground, punched them on the jaw, and pushed a knee into their throat. Art knelt there until the helpless servant stopped struggling, all trace of his twinkling charm gone.</p>
<p>Elena pointed at Art, "Strip that one. Get the rope, tie them up." She shifted her attention to Kend, "Scout out ahead. Don't take a candle, the light could give you away. If you see anyone at all, come straight back. We're not made yet, let's keep it that way."</p>
<p>Kend nodded, not trusting her voice. She crept forward, eyes straining against the darkness. The candles' light reached a few paces forward, but beyond that it was black as pitch. She closed her eyes and her other senses came alive. She smelled the chill of the rocks, the scent of a well-worn path. Coffee, grain, cloth, metal. All she could hear were rustles of fabric as her companions stripped the unconscious bodies behind her, and the heavy breathing of three people whose plans had been thrown into disarray. Her toe caught something as she stepped. There were grooves in the floor, only just noticeable through her boots. She slipped them off and ran her socked feet across the floor. The grooves were only a pace wide, but they ran straight down the centre of the corridor forward further than Kend dared to go. Her eyes snapped open and, adjusted to the darkness, could make out a hint of light at the end of the corridor. She returned to her compatriots.</p>
<p>Blinking in the candlelight that minutes before had seemed so dim, Kend was faced with a strange scene. The two servitors they had knocked out were on the ground wearing only their smallclothes, one still unconscious, the other struggling weakly against ropes binding her arms behind her back. There was a cloth stuffed into her mouth, but she made no attempt to scream through it. Art brandished his blackjack at her and the struggling stopped. She glowered back, pacified for the moment. Elena was undressed to the waist, legs wrapped in the odd clothing the two trussed prisoners were wearing minutes earlier. She gestured toward a pile of black fabric.</p>
<p>"Kend, put those on." She gave orders easily, and her eyes brooked no argument.</p>
<p>As Kend stripped down to her smallclothes with no trace of modesty, she told the others what she had discovered. Elena grunted at the reveal of the grooves, agreeing with Kend that they were likely used for navigation. When Elena was fully dressed, save for the head wrapping, she spoke.</p>
<p>"We've only got disguises enough for two, and Art and I agreed you need some muscle to back you up. He'll handle our new friends and meet us back at the hideout."</p>
<p>She knelt by the unconscious prisoner and gently slapped them awake. With a perfunctory goodbye, Art herded his new charges back down the tunnel, taking Kend's candle and Elena's blackjack with him.</p>
<p>Kend dressed as quickly as she could while Elena fiddled with the bags of coffee on the cart. She fingered the knife on her belt as she did, not realising what she was doing. Kend snapped her from her reverie.</p>
<p>"I'll lead the way so I can scout more easily," She directed her gaze at Elena's feet, "And take off your shoes. You have to be able to feel the floor."</p>
<p>Elena nodded wordlessly, the oppressive atmosphere muting all desire for conversation.</p>
<p>With a final look at the light of Art's candle disappearing down the tunnel, Elena snuffed hers, plunging the chamber into darkness. It made little difference when Kend pulled the fabric of her head wrapping over her eyes. With only the sounds of bare feet on stone and the cart's wheels turning, they pressed on.</p>
<p>Eyes open under her head wrapping, Kend could see a gradual brightening as they reached the end of the tunnel. She could feel the cool twilight air on her skin, though the flagstones she walked on still radiated the day's heat. Voices from above, music, and the sounds of running water filled the air, all inaudible outside the walls of the edifice, all hidden from the busy market outside the red rock walls. She held her breath, sure that any moment they would be recognised, that voices would be raised in alarm, that the two prisoners they left in Art's care would escape, that a god would see through their disguises and pass sentence, impaling them just as the carved demon on the edifice was.</p>
<p>No alarm came. No raised voices. She followed the grooves in the floor, cart trundling behind her, for what felt like an age. So far as she could tell, it ran ramrod straight, leading them across a wide open space. She could hear the susurration of silk above, mingling with the voices. Another age passed, and she could hear voices from ahead. They sounded muted, yet clipped and official, one strident voice rose above the rest, giving orders and directions. Kend nearly jumped out of her skin when the voice addressed them.</p>
<p>"Cart, halt," The voice paused for a moment, before continuing with a hit of exasperation, "Your cargo and your slate, please."</p>
<p>"Coffee," Kend blurted, before turning back to the cart and running her hands over the bags.</p>
<p>Did we bring the slate with us? She thought, hands steady despite the panic slowly taking over, I'm sure Art left it...</p>
<p>Her questing hands finally found what she was looking for: the slate, tucked between a sack of coffee and the side of the cart. She gripped it tightly, spun, and held it out in front of her.</p>
<p>"I...I have it here," she stammered.</p>
<p>"What are you waiting for, then?" the voice replied, "Step forward and hand it to me."</p>
<p>Following the grooves in the floor and holding the slate out, she edged forward. The slate bumped gently into something before it was snatched from her hands.</p>
<p>"There it is, finally. You know I don't have all day," The voice continued, "These offerings have to be presented to the gods. Head into the storeroom and unload. Coffee is the fourth pile to the right."</p>
<p>Kend heard feet shuffling and the scratch of chalk on the slate. Swallowing her panic, she led the way forward once more. The sound of voices faded abruptly and the flagstones grew cold under her feet, she knew she must be inside again. There were no sounds of movement from ahead, no voices, no water, no music.</p>
<p>A hand grabbed her arm. For the second time in as many minutes, Kend felt her chest gripped tight by panic. The iron fist around her heart loosened when she heard, in a whisper barely audible, Elena's voice.</p>
<p>"Keep looking forward. Loosen your eye-mask." Hot breath brushed her ear.</p>
<p>She reached up and worked a finger between the layers of fabric around her eyes, creating a tiny peephole. What she saw elicited a quiet gasp.</p>
<p>The storeroom, as the voice had called it, was massive. Lit by an occasional skylight, the ambience of twilight filtering through, the room was packed high with goods. At a glance she saw coffee, tea, fruits exotic and common, tobacco, crates of ales and treacles, yoghurt, honey; more waited around every corner. It was a cornucopia like nothing she had ever seen. Elena stood next to her, cart all but forgotten behind them. It was a minute before either of them could do anything but gape.</p>
<p>Kend was the first to recover. She tore her gaze away from the riches before them, turning back to the cart. The sound of movement snapped Elena from her reverie, and she helped Kend push it to the fourth pile on the right. Elena began to unload the cart, taking special care of the first bag, treating it as delicately as she could and lying it to the side. Ignoring Kend's questioning glances, Elena suggested she take a look outside, adjusting the clumsy peephole in her blindfold so she could see and not be seen in return. As she walked away, Elena hoisted the second bag off the cart, throwing it onto the pile with the rest of the coffee.</p>
<p>Kend, even prepared as she was by the opulence of the storeroom, was shocked when she looked outside. As she had suspected, the inside of the edifice was a vast courtyard, roof open to the purpling twilight sky above. Black-clad figures walked in straight lines through the courtyard, following the narrow paths carved into the flagstones. Above them floated gods. Some were dressed in their usual long silks, though some went without, choosing instead fine-cloth approximations of commoner garb. They were surrounded by beauty the likes of which Kend had never imagined existed. Greenery climbed the walls, more vegetation than Kend had ever seen, red rock completely hidden in places by vines and ferns and plants she could not name, flowers of every colour in bloom. Waterfalls cascaded from the tops of the walls, mist drifting amongst the higher reaches of the edifice, plants greedily drinking in the airborne moisture, dew beading on every surface. Small flames burned everywhere, bathing the square in soft light. Hammocks were strung between palms growing from walls high above the ground; fruit-laden trees and shrubs bowed over the hanging beds, providing fresh sustenance to reclining revellers. Music wove through the plaza, musicians dotted on platforms suspended in the open air. Most of the musicians were garbed in black, blindfolded against the idyllic scene, but Kend spied a few gods drifting lazily high above the square, idly plucking at an oud or tanbur. Food was carried by servants in black, gods swooping down and plucking pastries, sweetmeats, and kebabs from silver platters held aloft. It was paradise to Kend's eyes: an oasis in the middle of a dry, dusty city.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by sights, smells, and sounds, Kend was startled when silks drifted in front of her, occluding her vision for a moment. Her head snapped upward, and she came face-to-face with a god. Their silver mask leered at her, torchlight glinting from its polished surface; a rigid rictus hiding the face beneath.</p>
<p>A moment too late, she realised her mistake. She was supposed to be blind.</p>
<p>She backed into the storehouse, tripping over her feet in her haste to get away. She scrabbled backwards, trying to put as much distance between her and the doorway as she could. The god swept into the room, silks flapping behind them. They flew at Kend, hands outstretched as if to grab her.</p>
<p>A harsh click sounded from behind her. A bolt of wood appeared in the god's chest. They crashed face first into the ground, leaving a trail of red behind them.</p>
<p>Kend span. Elena stood behind her, coffee bag slashed open at her feet, beans spilled over the floor. A wooden contraption dangled limply from her hands.</p>
<p>She pointed a shaking finger at the god's corpse, "There's our mask."</p>
<p>Before Kend could think about what she was doing, she was on her knees heaving the body face-up. The wound on its chest had been made ugly by its unceremonious slide along the ground, splinters of the wooden bolt were scattered over the torso, and the original wound had been rent open. Kend's hands went to the mask, trembling fingers leaving bloodstains where they touched the gleaming metal.</p>
<p>She heard another clicking sound behind her, and realised Elena was still holding the weapon. She had the front of it resting on the ground, and she had pulled a string back, locking two wooden arms into place. She had removed the cloth wrapping her head and her close-cropped hair gleamed with sweat. She reached into the slashed bag of coffee beans and withdrew a bundle of bolts.</p>
<p>"Why do you have that thing? Where did you get it?" Kend hissed.</p>
<p>"Wyn gave it to me; she bought it from an outlander down at the docks. She said we would need something to cover our escape. She said the smuggler called it a crossbow." She shrugged, "Been practising with it every day for a month, but I've never made a shot like that."</p>
<p>Her grin was forced, face drawn and wan even in the warm light of the storeroom. "How does Godkiller Elena sound?"</p>
<p>Kend did not reply. She could not. All she could do was focus on the job. She reached once again to the silver mask before her. Her hands stopped shaking as she remembered what Wyn had told them. Riches beyond their wildest dreams, rewards beyond comprehension, safe passage to the outlands. They just had to steal a single mask. She flicked open the clasps and it came away. It was lighter than she had thought, almost weightless. It danced between her fingers, as if it was happy to be free. Light glinted off the features of the mask, playing over the raised corners of the mouth, twinkling off the wrinkles in the corners of its eyes. Now that she held it, it seemed not to sneer or grimace; the face seemed kind, joyful, happy. She felt a touch on her arm, but it did not seem important, the mask was important, the mask was special, the mask...</p>
<p>The hand on her arm tightened. She jerked, the sudden shock snapping her back to reality. Elena stood beside her. The muscle-bound woman had the crossbow resting on her shoulder, finger on the release-trigger.</p>
<p>"Kend?" She was dimly aware Elena had been calling her name for minutes, "We need to go. Who knows when the next servant will come through that door?"</p>
<p>Kend nodded, tearing her eyes from the mask. She slipped it into the folds of her clothing, making sure it was safely hidden from prying eyes.</p>
<p>"While you were fiddling with that thing, I had a look around the storeroom." Elena continued, "That door's the only way out."</p>
<p>Kend nodded again, still too shaken to talk, let alone suggest an escape route.</p>
<p>Elena waited a moment, then went on, "We put the headwraps on again, we walk back out of here pushing the wheelbarrow, and we take that tunnel back to the coffee house." She grinned, and this time it was genuine, "We give Wyn the mask, collect our pay, and live out the rest of our days in luxury."</p>
<p>She placed the crossbow in the bottom of the cart, covered it with an empty coffee sack, and gave Kend an encouraging smile.</p>
<p>"Ready?"</p>
<p>Moving mechanically, Kend picked herself off the ground, dimly aware of her knees hurting from the hard floor, wrapped her head in black cloth, and checked the mask was secured carefully under her clothes.</p>
<p>"Let's go." The pair looked at each other, catching a moment of eye contact through the peepholes in their head-wraps.</p>
<p> <br>They made it three-quarters across the courtyard before the alarm went up. A chance gust of wind lifted the empty coffee bag into the air, revealing the hidden weapon. Drawn to the sudden movement, the eyes of every god were upon them. They shouted something and spears were in their hands, shouted something else and they began to dive at Elena. She whisked the crossbow and bolts out of the cart and broke into a run, drawing ahead of the startled Kend. They were close, but the gods were fast. Five paces before the tunnel, Elena took a spear to the calf. Blood spattered on the flagstones, dying them a bright red. She spun as she fell. She pulled the trigger. Another god dead, this one falling from the sky with an audible crunch. More bright red flagstones. Figuring that would give their pursuers pause, Kend grabbed her shirt, dragging her into the mouth of the tunnel. They locked eyes. Neither said anything, but Kend knew what she had to do.</p>
<p>She ran. The light from outside filtered through for the first few steps, but after that it was darkness. The sound of breaking glass came from behind her, and the tunnel ahead was illuminated for a second by flame, hot air tickling her back. She heard Elena scream. Gods could throw balls of fire.</p>
<p>She ran. All she had to guide her were the grooves in the floor. She passed the stone door they had entered through at a sprint. The thought of running into Art and his prisoners crossed her mind, but her steps did not slow. If she ran into something, she would get hurt. If she got caught, she was dead.</p>
<p>Kend's legs and chest ached, sweat ran into her eyes, but she kept running, remembering to crouch slightly under the low ceiling. Between her breaths, she thought she heard the flapping of silk behind her. She did not look back. Finally, she caught sight of her destination. The trapdoor that led to the coffee shop was illuminated, flickering light worming its way through the old, cracked wood. She was up the steps in a flash, wrenching the door open and flinging herself through it. She turned, barring the door, before realising what was wrong.</p>
<p>The shop was on fire. Everywhere she looked there were flames and choking black smoke scented with the smell of burning coffee. Hands pounded on the door behind her, but the bar held fast. Her back to the door, she slumped to the floor. The gods had gotten here first. She screamed in frustration, voice swallowed by the inferno.</p>
<p>Fire blazed all around her, hungry tongues licking ever closer. The tell-tale sounds of the gods' fireballs rang out from time to time, feeding the inferno that had her trapped. A corner of the roof collapsed, sending fresh air rushing inside, the flames surging to greater heights. Kend could see the night sky through the hole, twinkling stars beckoning her forward, drawing her closer. She found her hand inside her shirt, holding the mask in a white-knuckle grip. She took it out, the roar of the fire all but forgotten. The mask smiled at her, the reflections of flames upon it so bright her eyes hurt; it was weightless, as if she could throw it and it would sail on forever.</p>
<p>Kend turned the mask over, seeing the underside for the first time. It was moulded, custom-fit for a particular face. It looked familiar. The mouth with lips thin and drawn. The nose crooked where it had been broken in her youth. It was her face.</p>
<p>She put it on. Her hands tightened the buckles automatically. It was a perfect fit. The metal was cool on her face despite the heat. She looked up at the stars again, and this time they grew to fill her vision. The heat of the flames faded, replaced by the cool chill of night. She looked down and the city fell away, market stalls, coffee houses, even the red rock edifice fading to specks beneath her. Some vague shapes surrounded the coffee house she had been trapped in, tiny lights leaving their hands to blossom against the burning walls.</p>
<p>She lazily turned toward the docks, facing the sea and the lands beyond. She smiled, her face a perfect imitation of her mask.<br><br><br>
